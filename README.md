‚Ä¢	Separated the encryption and decryption logic into different functions.
‚Ä¢	Added comments and docstrings to explain the functions and their parameters.
‚Ä¢	Ensured consistent coding style by following PEP 8 guidelines.

Day 5 : 
‚Ä¢	Conducted a self-review of the project, ensuring all components function as intended.

Week 2 : 

Day 1: 

‚Ä¢	Task: Understand the project requirements and research on pixel manipulation techniques for image encryption.

‚Ä¢	Progress: Researched various techniques for pixel manipulation, including swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations. Decided to use the XOR operation for encryption and decryption.

Day 2: 

‚Ä¢	Task: Implement the image encryption tool using the Pillow library for image processing.
‚Ä¢	Progress: Wrote a Python script that uses the XOR operation to encrypt and decrypt images. The script loads the input image, applies the XOR operation to each pixel, and saves the encrypted image.
.

Day 3 :

‚Ä¢	Task: Test the image encryption tool with different images and keys.
‚Ä¢	Progress: Tested the script with various images and keys, verifying that the encryption and decryption processes work correctly.

Day 4 : 

‚Ä¢	Task: Refine the encryption algorithm to improve security.
‚Ä¢	Progress: Explored additional techniques such as using different keys for different parts of the image or incorporating other encryption algorithms.

Day 5 : 
‚Ä¢	Conducted a self-review of the project, ensuring all components function as intended.

Week 3: 

Day 1: 

‚Ä¢	Task: Determine password complexity criteria
‚Ä¢	Progress: Completed. Determined the complexity criteria for the password checker, ensuring that the criteria are comprehensive and effective in ensuring password security.

Day 2: 

‚Ä¢	Task: Design user interface
‚Ä¢	Progress: Completed. Designed a simple user interface using Python's Tkinter library. The interface includes a text box for users to input their passwords and a button to submit the password for checking.
.

Day 3 :

‚Ä¢	Task: Implement algorithm to check password complexity
‚Ä¢	Progress: Completed. Implemented the algorithm to check the complexity of passwords. The algorithm checks for the following criteria:
‚Ä¢	Length: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
‚Ä¢	Uppercase Letters: Checks for at least one uppercase letter.
‚Ä¢	Lowercase Letters: Checks for at least one lowercase letter.
‚Ä¢	Numbers: Checks for at least one number.
‚Ä¢	Special Characters: Checks for at least one special character.

Day 4 : 

‚Ä¢	Task: Implement error handling and common password check
‚Ä¢	Progress: Completed. Implemented error handling to handle invalid inputs, such as empty passwords or passwords that do not meet the complexity criteria. Also, implemented a check to alert users if their password is common.

Day 5 :
 
‚Ä¢	Conducted a comprehensive review and finalized the entire application.

Week 4 : 

Day 1: 

‚Ä¢	Task: Understand the concept of keyloggers and their importance in cybersecurity.

‚Ä¢	Progress: Read and analyzed the sources provided, including Coursehero, Malwarebytes. Understand the different types of keyloggers, their mechanisms, and their uses.

Day 2: 

‚Ä¢	Task: Learn how to design a keylogger in Python.
‚Ä¢	Progress: Studied the Python libraries required for designing a keylogger. Understood the code structure and how to set up event handlers for keyboard events and log keystrokes.

Day 3 :

‚Ä¢	Task: Enhance the logging functionality and improve data security and efficiency
‚Ä¢	Progress: Enhance the logging feature to support special characters and enhance file processing to guarantee efficiency and data security
Day 4 : 

‚Ä¢	Task: Refactor and code and increase code readability 
‚Ä¢	Progress: Refactored code to increase the code readability and understandability 

Day 5 : 
‚Ä¢	Conducted a self-review of the project, ensuring all components function as intended.
